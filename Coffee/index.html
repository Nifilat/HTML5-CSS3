 <p style="width: 50%;">House Blends can often be described as reliable and straightforward – a blend that is a “go-to” in a coffee shop. They
 are generally seen as a consistent and high-value product that you can count on. The brew of a house blend coffee is different than that of a breakfast blend or espresso roast – meaning that when you
 pour a cup of a house blend coffee, you should expect to fall somewhere in the middle of a light roast and dark roast
 and have intermediate flavor.</p>
