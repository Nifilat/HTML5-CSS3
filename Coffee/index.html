 <p style="width: 50%;">House Blends can often be described as reliable and straightforward – a blend that is a “go-to” in a coffee shop. They
 are generally seen as a consistent and high-value product that you can count on. The brew of a house blend coffee is different than that of a breakfast blend or espresso roast – meaning that when you
 pour a cup of a house blend coffee, you should expect to fall somewhere in the middle of a light roast and dark roast
 and have intermediate flavor.</p>

 <p style="width: 50%;">Colombian coffee is coffee that is grown in Colombia. Colombian coffee tends to demand a higher price because it is
 mostly made up of the superior arabica variety. Colombian coffees can have heavy notes of chocolate and nuts, or lighter
 fruit and floral notes, depending on which department it’s grown.</p>
